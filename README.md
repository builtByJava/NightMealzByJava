# NightMealzByJava


Greetings! 

NightMealz - v1.0

I will build a simple full-stack app with a FE of Bootstrap, AngularJS, and a BE in Java for food delivery services. In this original version, I aim to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming Principles & Design that I have been learning and keep things simple on the BE. Additionally, I aim to demonstrate my FE skills with HTML, CSS, JS, AngularJS, and BootStrap. My future goal is to have several follow-on versions where I slowly grow my capability more. Thanks for reading and happy coding!
