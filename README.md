# NightMealzByJava


Greetings! 

NightMealz - v1.0

I will be building a command-line interactive program in Java for food delivery services. In this original version, my goal is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming Principles & Design that I have been learning and keep things simple. My future goal is to have several follow on versions where I slowly grow the capability, GUI, and more. Thanks for reading and happy coding!
